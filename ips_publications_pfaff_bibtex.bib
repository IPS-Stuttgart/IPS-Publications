Previously, we have equipped an experimental optical belt sorter with an area scan camera and were able to show that tracking the particles of the bulk material results in an improvement of the predictions and thus also the sorting process. In this paper, we use the slight gap between the sensor lines of an RGB line scan camera to derive information about the particles' movements in real-time. This approach allows improving the predictions in optical belt sorters without necessitating any hardware modifications.},

	abstract = {In state estimation theory, two directions are mainly followed in order to model disturbances and errors. Either uncertainties are modeled as stochastic quantities or they are characterized by their membership to a set. Both approaches have distinct advantages and disadvantages making each one inherently better suited to model different sources of estimation uncertainty. This paper is dedicated to the task of combining stochastic and set-membership estimation methods. A Kalman gain is derived that minimizes the mean squared error in the presence of both stochastic and additional unknown but bounded uncertainties, which are represented by Gaussian random variables and ellipsoidal sets, respectively. As a result, a generalization of the well-known Kalman filtering scheme is attained that reduces to the standard Kalman filter in the absence of set-membership uncertainty and that otherwise becomes the intersection of sets in case of vanishing stochastic uncertainty. The proposed concept also allows to prioritize either the minimization of the stochastic uncertainty or the minimization of the set-membership uncertainty.},

Both concepts have distinct advantages and disadvantages making each one inherently better suited to model different sources of estimation uncertainty. In order to better utilize the potentials of both concepts, the core element of this paper is a Kalman filtering scheme that allows for a simultaneous treatment of stochastic and set-membership uncertainties. An uncertain quantity is herein modeled by a set of Gaussian densities. Since many modern applications operate in networked systems that may consist of a multitude of local processing units and sensor nodes, estimates have to be computed in a distributed manner and measurements may arrive at high frequency. An algebraic reformulation of the Kalman filter, the information filter, significantly eases the implementation of such distributed fusion architectures. This paper explicates how stochastic and set-membership uncertainties can simultaneously be treated within this information form and compared to the Kalman filter, it becomes apparent that the quality of some required approximations is enhanced.},

This representation is preserved throughout filter and prediction steps and allows obtaining a valid density at any point in time. Additionally, analytic formulae for calculating Fourier coefficients of the square root of some common circular densities are provided. In our evaluation, we show that this new filter performs well in both unimodal and multimodal scenarios while requiring only a reasonable number of coefficients.},

In this paper, we will show that a similar property can be proven for certain hyperspherical probability distributions, namely the von Mises�Fisher and the Watson distribution.

	abstract = {State estimation concepts like the Kalman filter heavily rely on potentially noisy sensor data. In general, the estimation quality depends on the amount of sensor data that can be exploited. However, missing observations do not necessarily impair the estimation quality but may also convey exploitable information on the system state. This type of information - noted as negative information - often requires specific measurement and noise models in order to take advantage of it. In this paper, a hybrid Kalman filter concept is employed that allows using both stochastic and set-membership representations of information. In particular, the latter representation is intended to account for negative information, which can often be easily described as a bounded set in the measurement space. Depending on the type of information, the filtering step of the proposed estimator adaptively switches between Gaussian and ellipsoidal noise representations. A target tracking scenario is studied to evaluate and discuss the proposed concept.},

This paper adds the capability of handling arbitrary transition densities in the prediction step, which facilitates, e.g., the use of the filters for nonlinear systems with additive noise.

If this condition is met, the DKF allows deriving the optimal estimate if all information is combined in one node at an arbitrary time step.

Such systems face the challenge of an existing delay between perception and separation of the material. To reliably predict an object's position when reaching the separation stage, information regarding its movement needs to be derived. Multitarget tracking offers approaches through which this can be achieved. However, processing time is typically limited since the sorting decision for each object needs to be derived sufficiently early before it reaches the separation stage. In this paper, an approach for multitarget tracking in sensor-based sorting is proposed which supports establishing an upper bound regarding processing time required for solving the measurement to track association problem. To demonstrate the success of the proposed method, experiments are conducted for data-sets obtained via simulation of a sorting system. This way, it is possible to not only demonstrate the impact on required runtime but also on the quality of the association.},

In this paper, we evaluate both the suitability of our model and the tracking and then of our entire system incorporating the image processing component via the use of highly realistic numerical simulations. We first assess the model using noise-free measurements generated by the simulation and then evaluate the entire system by using synthetically generated image data.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel online approach for tracking whole-body human motion based on unlabeled measurements of markers attached to the body. For that purpose, we employ a given kinematic model of the human body including the locations of the attached markers. Based on the model, we apply a combination of constrained sample-based Kalman filtering and multi-target tracking techniques: 1) joint constraints imposed by the human body are satisfied by introducing a parameter transformation based on periodic functions, 2) a global nearest neighbor (GNN) algorithm computes the most likely one-to-one association between markers and measurements, and 3) multiple hypotheses tracking (MHT) allows for a robust initialization that only requires an upright standing user. Evaluations clearly demonstrate that the proposed tracking provides highly accurate pose estimates in real-time, even for fast and complex motions. In addition, it provides robustness to partial occlusion of markers and also handles unavoidable clutter measurements.},

The correct representation of the resulting particle–fluid interaction is realized through a one-way coupling of the DEM with CFD. Complex shaped particle clusters are employed to model peppercorns also used in experimental investigations. To test the correct implementation of the utilized models, the particle mass flow within the sorter is compared between experiment and simulation.

The Discrete Element Method (DEM) is used to model the sorter and calculate the particle movement as well as particle � particle and particle � wall interactions. The particle ejection stage with air valves is described with the help of a MATLAB script utilizing particle movement information obtained with the DEM. Two models for predicting the particle movement between the detection and separation phase are implemented and compared. In the first model, it is assumed that the particles are moving with belt velocity and without any cross movements and a conventional line scan camera is used for particle detection. In the second model, a more sophisticated approach is employed where the particle motion is predicted with an area scan camera combined with a tracking algorithm. In addition, the influence of different operating parameters like particle shape or conveyor belt length on the separation quality of the system is investigated. Results show that numerical simulations can offer detailed insight into the operation performance of optical sorters and help to optimize operating parameters. The area scan camera approach was found to be superior to the standard line scan camera model in almost all investigated categories.},

The accuracy of the employed numerical approach is ensured by comparing the separation results of a predefined sorting task with experimental investigations. The quality of the aforementioned prediction models is compared when utilizing different belt lengths, nozzle activation durations, particle types, sampling frequencies and detection windows. Results show that the numerical model of the optical belt sorter is able to accurately describe the sorting system and is suitable for detailed investigation of various operational parameters.

Sensor-based sorting is a machine vision application for which firm real-time requirements need to be respected in order to reliably remove potentially harmful entities from a material feed. Recently, employing a predictive tracking approach using multitarget tracking in order to decrease the error in the physical separation in optical sorting has been proposed. For implementations that use hard associations between measurements and tracks, a linear assignment problem has to be solved for each frame recorded by a camera. The auction algorithm can be utilized for this purpose, which also has the advantage of being well suited for parallel architectures. In this paper, an improved implementation of this algorithm for a graphics processing unit (GPU) is presented. The resulting algorithm is implemented in both an OpenCL and a CUDA based environment. By using an optimized data structure, the presented algorithm outperforms recently proposed implementations in terms of speed while retaining the quality of output of the algorithm. Furthermore, memory requirements are significantly decreased, which is important for embedded systems. Experimental results are provided for two different GPUs and six datasets. It is shown that the proposed approach is of particular interest for applications dealing with comparatively large problem sizes.},

While state-of-the-art systems utilize scanning sensors such as line-scan cameras, advances in sensor technology have made application of area scanning sensors feasible. Provided a sufficiently high frame rate, objects can be observed at multiple points in time. By applying multiobject tracking, information about the objects contained in the material stream can be fused over time. Based on this information, our approach further allows predicting the position of each object for future points in time. While conventional systems typically apply a global, rather simple motion model, our approach includes an individual motion model for each object, which in turn allows estimating the point in time as well as the position when reaching the separation stage. In this contribution, we present results from our collaborative research project and summarize the present advances by discussing the potential of the application of area-scan sensors for sensor-based sorting.
